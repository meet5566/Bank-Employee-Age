## Bank Employee Age Analysis
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze the age data of bank employees. The specific goals are:
To understand the age distribution of employees across all bank departments.
To use data analysis to identify any potential correlations between an employee's age and other factors, such as performance, experience, or department.
To provide data-driven insights based on this demographic data to support the bank's workforce planning and HR strategy.

# Conclusion
This Data Analytics case study successfully analyzed the bank's employee workforce, with a primary focus on age. By examining the Bank_dataset_Clean.csv dataset, we identified key demographic trends, including the average employee age and the age distribution across different departments.
A significant finding, confirmed by the Weka Linear Regression analysis (Weka_LinearRegression_Result.txt), is the correlation between an employee's age and their salary.
The insights from this analysis, visually summarized in the image.png dashboard, can directly support the bank's HR department. These findings are valuable for workforce planning, managing career progression, and ensuring fair salary structures.
